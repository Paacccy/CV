## Problem Statement

### Problem 1: Static CV Presentation

Traditional CVs are static and usually presented in a text document (PDF, Word, etc.) or printed format. This approach limits the potential for interactive features like media, updates, and links to live examples of work.

### Solution

The CV web project solves this problem by offering a dynamic online version of the CV. This version can be constantly updated, and users can interact with different sections without the need for a new download. The online CV allows for the inclusion of rich media like videos, images, and links to portfolios or social media profiles.

### Problem 2: Lack of Personal Branding Online

Many professionals struggle to present their professional identity online in an engaging way. Personal websites or online portfolios are often complex to create, requiring advanced technical skills.

### Solution

This CV web project provides a simple and elegant solution for showcasing personal branding. With just a few clicks, a user can have an interactive and professional online CV, which highlights their qualifications, experience, and portfolio. The project enables anyone to build their online presence without needing any advanced coding skills.

### Problem 3: Limited Interaction with CV Data

Traditional CV formats like PDFs or Word documents are limited when it comes to user interaction. For instance, users cannot interact with the CV to explore specific sections (e.g., portfolio items, past job roles, etc.).

### Solution

The web-based CV allows users to click through various sections like About, Resume, Services, and more. This interactivity makes the experience more engaging and allows users to focus on the information that interests them the most, offering a more personalized experience.
